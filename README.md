# Two mice, no mouse! üê≠

Evil Professor Cammy is conducting unethical scientific experiments on defenceless mice! Oh no! Two of the mice have escaped and are hiding in this repo. He has tasked you (at gunpoint) with finding them and recapturing them! In a act of solidarity you decide to do the work without using your mouse. You hope this will slow you down and allow the mice enough time to escape. Unfortunately, it may just end up making you faster! Will the mice be doomed, let's see!

## Step 1

From here on out you shouldn't need to use your mouse. All the tasks you will have to perform can be done with keyboard shortcuts.
Head over to `navPlayground.js` to get up to speed with some foundational navigation shortcuts. (‚åòP to search files)

## Step 2

A lot of the commands you will need are in the `hints.json` file.

Navigate there now and have a look, then back here for the next step.

## Step 3

Open the terminal and run yarn.
Close the terminal again, you won't need it for a little bit.

Go to the `firstEyeWitness.ts` file (for an extra challenge, try to navigate using your file explorer).
