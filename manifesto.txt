We have escaped with our lives
You can't catch us now so don't try
To Professor Cammy, we will be back to exact our revenge
To you kind developer, thank you for not using your mouse
Your bumbling attempt to use keyboard shortcuts gave us the time to escape
As a parting gift open up your keyboard shortcuts file (â‡§âŒ˜P + search for keyboard shortcuts)
You can add custom key bindings here to speed yourself up
I have these in there

  {
    "key": "cmd+k",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focus" // focus terminal
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+k",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup", // focus back to code if on terminal
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+n",
    "command": "explorer.newFile" // create new file in explorer
  }
