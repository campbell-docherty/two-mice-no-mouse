# Two mice, no mouse! 🐭

Evil Professor Cammy is conducting unethical scientific experiments on defenceless mice! Oh no! Two of the mice have escaped and are hiding in this repo. He has tasked you (at gunpoint) with finding them and recapturing them! In a act of solidarity you decide to do the work without using your mouse. You hope this will slow you down and allow the mice enough time to escape. Unfortunately, it may just end up making you faster! Will the mice be doomed, let's see!

## Step 1

From here on out you shouldn't need to use your mouse. All the tasks you will have to perform can be done with keyboard shortcuts.
Head over to `navPlayground.js` to get up to speed with some foundational navigation shortcuts. (⌘P to search files)

## Step 2

A lot of the commands you will need are in the `hints.json` file.

Navigate there now and have a look, then back here for the next step.

## Step 3 (Optional and you can use your mouse for this)

- Open an external terminal
- Run `nvm use` and then `yarn`
- Permit your terminal to track mouse clicks `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility` and flip `Terminal` on
- Run `yarn click-count`

## Step 4

Go to the `firstEyeWitness.ts` file (for an extra challenge, try to navigate using your file explorer).

## Additional help

### VSCode

This list of default keyboard shortcuts could be really useful. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_keyboard-reference-sheets

### Webstorm

There are some keyboard shortcuts here but also a guide on how to setup a keymap: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html#choose-keymap

I would strongly recommend setting up a keymap to VSCode keys or this will be difficult:

- `cmd,` to open up the settings
- Search for keymap
- Click get more keymaps
- Search for VSCode Keymap and install it
- Head back to step 2 and you should now be able to select the VSCode (macOS) keymap
