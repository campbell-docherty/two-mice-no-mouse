// Try to grab this whole line with âŒ˜L

// Copy and paste this line by pressing âŒ˜C + âŒ˜V
// Delete me with âŒ˜âŒ« or âŒ˜X to cut me

// This line is long to read, jump to the end with âŒ˜â†’. This line is a super long line and you have to add some more text to the end of it, it's quite long to move your cursor all the way along the line so that you can read the end. Hey, have a nice day :)

// Jump Over These Words With âŒ¥â†’

// The above navigation shortcuts can be combined with â‡§ to select as you move.
// Select just THIS word. â‡§âŒ¥â†’
// Select THIS word all the way until the end of the line. â‡§âŒ˜â†’

// A really really really really repetetive line. Select all the 'really' with âŒ˜D and then type 'super' to replace them all at once.
// Press esc to move your cursor back to one (top tip: esc can be used to get out of lots of selection and search modes)

// I actually have a twin brother, I don't know where he is though ğŸ‘€. (â‡§âŒ¥â†‘)

// I don't mind being at the bottom
// I'm scared down here at the bottom ğŸ«¨. Move me up a line with âŒ¥â†‘

// Okay feel free to hang around here and keep practicing, otherwise you can head back to the README (âŒƒ- to back up until you get there)
