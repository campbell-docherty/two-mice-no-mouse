# Two mice, no mouse!

Evil Professor Cammy is conducting unethical scientific experiments on defenceless mice! Oh no! Two of the mice have escaped and are hiding in this repo. He has tasked you (at gunpoint) with finding them and recapturing them! In a act of solidarity you decide to do the work without using your mouse. You hope this will slow you down and allow the mice enough time to escape. Unfortunately, it may just end up making you faster! Will the mice be doomed, let's see!
